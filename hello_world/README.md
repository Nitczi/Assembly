# Objective
So, this is a simple 'hello world'(or 'hello friend'). in assembly. Different from other languages, in assembly we can understand more concepts and how a machine works. I'll explain each line and why we use each command and values, somethings i will not explain, like the sections.

# Explanation

The first thing we need to define for printing a message, is define which message we will print out. In assembly we need to:
1. Define a label;
2. Chose a directive to indicate how much data we will "create";
3. Set the value we want to print out.

In our code, the label is `message`
